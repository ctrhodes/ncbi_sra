# Managing R packages with Conda

When you use R with conda you need to stick to conda as much as you can. Whenever possible, DON'T LET R INSTALL PACKAGES FOR YOU. In other words, ALWAYS USE CONDA TO INSTALL THE PACKAGES YOU NEED unless there is not a conda recipe for that package. In that case, see below.

Important note about installing R packages (adapted from [here](https://community.rstudio.com/t/why-not-r-via-conda/9438/4)):
Do not mix conda proprietary channels (anaconda, r) with open-source channels (conda-forge, bioconda, defaults). Problems will arise. R versions in different channels are often not compatible as they are compiled with different internals. If you setup R with the setup scripts in this repo, there will be a R library folder for installing external R libraries from CRAN/Bioconductor/Github, created in the current working directory. If you must install R packages directly in R (conda recipe not available), always specify the library path in R using something like:

```
install.packages(pkgs, lib=Sys.getenv('./R/4.0/library')
```

This will very likely install packages that have already been installed via conda channels, including those installed in r-essentials. Consequently, when installing an R package externally (and if you need to do this a lot, then conda may not be the solution for you), look up the dependencies in the docs and install those first with conda.
